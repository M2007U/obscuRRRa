# Obscurrra v0.4 Release Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the changes made in the transition from Obscurrra v0.3 to Obscurrra v0.4. The new version introduces several improvements in code modularity, face detection accuracy, and logging.

## Summary of Changes

Obscurrra v0.4 includes the following major updates:

- Refactored codebase for better modularity
- Enhanced face detection with updated models and techniques
- Improved logging and error handling

## Detailed Changes

### Refactored Codebase

- **Modular Design**: The code has been refactored into multiple classes for better modularity and maintainability. This includes separating functionalities into `Preprocessor`, `FaceDetection`, `FaceBlurrer`, and `ImageProcessor` classes.
  ```python
  # Example of class structure
  class ImageProcessor:
      def __init__(self):
          self.preprocessor = Preprocessor()
          self.face_detection = FaceDetection()
          self.face_blurrer = FaceBlurrer()
  ```

### Enhanced Face Detection

- **Improved Models**: Enhanced face detection using the latest versions of MTCNN and Haar Cascades for better accuracy and reliability.
  ```python
  class FaceDetection:
      def __init__(self):
          self._mtcnn_detector = MTCNN()
  ```

### Improved Logging and Error Handling

- **Enhanced Logging**: Improved logging for better tracking of the programâ€™s execution and error handling.
  ```python
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
  ```

### Usage Instructions

To use Obscurrra v0.4, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Main Script**: Execute the `obscurrra-v0.4.py` script to start the face detection and blurring process.
   ```bash
   python obscurrra-v0.4.py
   ```
2. **Monitor Logs**: Monitor the log report in real-time through the terminal.

## Result

In a test involving 301 profile images, Obscurrra v0.4 accurately processed 299 images, maintaining the high accuracy of about 99.3355% from the previous version. The images were 128px x 128px.

## Conclusion

Obscurrra v0.4 offers a more modular and maintainable image processing tool with improved face detection models and enhanced logging. These enhancements make the tool more reliable and easier to use.
