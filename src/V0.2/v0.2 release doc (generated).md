# Obscurrra v0.2 Release Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the changes made in the transition from Obscurrra v0.1 to Obscurrra v0.2. The new version introduces several improvements in code structure, error handling, and functionality.

## Summary of Changes

Obscurrra v0.2 includes the following major updates:

- Refactoring for better modularity and readability
- Enhanced error handling
- Support for additional image formats
- Improved face detection and blurring functionality

## Detailed Changes

### Refactoring for Modularity and Readability

- **Class Structure**: Introduced `DirectoryManager`, `ImageProcessor`, and `MainProgram` classes to encapsulate functionalities, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
  ```python
  class DirectoryManager:
      ...

  class ImageProcessor:
      ...

  class MainProgram:
      ...
  ```

### Enhanced Error Handling

- **Directory Management**: Added error handling for directory operations.
  ```python
  @staticmethod
  def create_output_directory(output_folder):
      try:
          if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
              os.makedirs(output_folder)
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Error creating output directory {output_folder}: {e}")
          raise e
  ```
- **Face Detection Models**: Improved error messages for loading face detection models.
  ```python
  @staticmethod
  def load_face_detection_models():
      try:
          face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(ImageProcessor.FACE_CASCADE_PATH)
          if face_cascade.empty():
              raise ValueError("Error loading cascade file. Check the path to haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml.")
          return face_cascade
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Error loading face detection models: {e}")
          raise e
  ```

### Support for Additional Image Formats

- **Image Processing**: Added support for processing `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.webp` image formats.
  ```python
  IMAGE_EXTENSIONS = ['*.jpg', '*.jpeg', '*.png', '*.webp']
  ```

### Improved Face Detection and Blurring

- **Face Detection**: Enhanced face detection with adjustable parameters.
  ```python
  @staticmethod
  def detect_faces(gray, face_cascade):
      try:
          faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
          return faces
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Error detecting faces: {e}")
          raise e
  ```
- **Blurring Faces**: Applied a blur effect to detected face regions.
  ```python
  @staticmethod
  def blur_faces(img, faces):
      try:
          for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
              img[y:y+h, x:x+w] = cv2.blur(img[y:y+h, x:x+w], ImageProcessor.BLUR_EFFECT)
          return img
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Error blurring faces: {e}")
          raise e
  ```

### Usage Instructions

To use Obscurrra v0.2, run the `obscurrra-v0.2.py` script in your environment. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, particularly `OpenCV`. Place your images in the input directory and execute the script to process and save the blurred images in the output directory.

```bash
python obscurrra-v0.2.py
```

## Result

Out of 101 profile images, it accurately processed 95 of them. That is about 94% accurate in that test.

The images were 128px x 128px

## Conclusion

Obscurrra v0.2 provides a more robust and versatile image processing tool with improved modularity, error handling, and support for various image formats. These enhancements aim to make the tool more efficient and user-friendly.
