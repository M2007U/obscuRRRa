# Obscurrra v0.3 Release Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the changes made in the transition from Obscurrra v0.2 to Obscurrra v0.3. The new version introduces several improvements in face detection accuracy, image processing efficiency, and code maintainability.

## Summary of Changes

Obscurrra v0.3 includes the following major updates:

- Initialization and property method improvements for face detection models
- Enhanced face detection with the MTCNN model
- Adjustments to the face detection and blurring process
- Improved resizing logic for better face detection accuracy

## Detailed Changes

### Initialization and Property Method Improvements

- **MTCNN Initialization**: Ensured proper initialization of the MTCNN face detection model in the `ImageProcessor` class.
  ```python
  class ImageProcessor:
      def __init__(self):
          self._mtcnn_detector = MTCNN()
  ```
- **Property Methods**: Improved property methods for accessing face detection models.
  ```python
  @property
  def mtcnn_detector(self):
      return self._mtcnn_detector

  @property
  def front_face_cascade(self):
      if not hasattr(self, '_front_face_cascade'):
          self._front_face_cascade = self._load_face_detection_model(self.front_face_cascade_path)
      return self._front_face_cascade

  @property
  def profile_face_cascade(self):
      if not hasattr(self, '_profile_face_cascade'):
          self._profile_face_cascade = self._load_face_detection_model(self.profile_face_cascade_path)
      return self._profile_face_cascade
  ```

### Enhanced Face Detection with MTCNN

- **MTCNN Detection**: Improved face detection using the MTCNN model for better accuracy and reliability.
  ```python
  def detect_faces_mtcnn(self, image):
      try:
          results = self.mtcnn_detector.detect_faces(image)
          faces = []
          for result in results:
              x, y, width, height = result['box']
              faces.append((x, y, width, height))
          return faces
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Error detecting faces with MTCNN: {e}")
          raise e
  ```

### Adjustments to Face Detection and Blurring Process

- **Blurring Faces**: Applied a blur effect to detected face regions, ensuring better protection of privacy.
  ```python
  @staticmethod
  def blur_faces(img, faces):
      try:
          for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
              img[y:y+h, x:x+w] = cv2.blur(img[y:y+h, x:x+w], ImageProcessor.BLUR_EFFECT)
          return img
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Error blurring faces: {e}")
          raise e
  ```

### Improved Resizing Logic

- **Image Resizing**: Enhanced the image resizing logic to ensure face detection accuracy by maintaining the aspect ratio and scaling face coordinates appropriately.
  ```python
  @staticmethod
  def resize_image(image, max_dimension):
      height, width = image.shape[:2]
      if max(height, width) > max_dimension:
          scale = max_dimension / max(height, width)
          new_size = (int(width * scale), int(height * scale))
          resized_image = cv2.resize(image, new_size, interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
          return resized_image
      return image
  ```

### Usage Instructions

To use Obscurrra v0.3, run the `obscurrra-v0.3.py` script in your environment. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, particularly `OpenCV` and `MTCNN`. Place your images in the input directory and execute the script to process and save the blurred images in the output directory.

```bash
python obscurrra-v0.3.py
```

## Result

Out of 301 profile images, it accurately processed 299 of them. That is about 99.3355% accurate in that test.

The images were 128px x 128px

## Conclusion

Obscurrra v0.3 provides a more robust and versatile image processing tool with enhanced face detection accuracy, improved modularity, and better image processing efficiency. These enhancements aim to make the tool more reliable and user-friendly.
